<p className="more-article-text1">
  Aperol is a brand of bitter orange liqueur, which was created in 1919 by the Italian company Campari.<br></br> 
  The name Aperol is derived from the Italian words <strong>"aperire"</strong> (to open) and <strong>"oro"</strong> (gold), 
  referring to the golden color of the liqueur. Aperol is known for its unique taste and vibrant orange color, 
  and it has become a popular choice for cocktails and as a digestif. The brand has expanded beyond Italy and is now 
  available in many countries around the world. People love Aperol because it's a refreshing and<br></br> 
  easy-to-drink drink that can be enjoyed on its own or as a mixer for cocktails. It's also a great way to start 
  a meal or to enjoy after dinner.
